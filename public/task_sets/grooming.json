  "protocol": "Protocol for Lap Grooming Ritual: Building Trust Through Touch",
  "description": "We start by laying the puppy gently across the lap, stroking the belly — a reflex that dogs recognise from their mothers, who do this after feeding to stimulate digestion. This familiar, soothing gesture helps the dog relax and open up emotionally. Once the dog is calm, we can check the paws, ears, or even trim nails — all without fear or tension. The key is to make it a bonding ritual, not a technical task. It's something between you and your dog — a private space of care and communication.",
